# ROTMGDesktop for Mac

I wrote this to make playing Realm of the Mad God a little bit easier; I hate running it from my browser because it's so slow.
Just click the icon and you'll be able to play ROTMG fullscreen on your desktop!

## Installation

You'll need Adobe Flash Projector.

Download it from Adobe's website by following (this link)[https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html]

And clicking on "Download the Flash Player Projector."

If you get an error about permissions, you may need to allow the app access to "Accessibility." Go to the Privacy tab of the Security and Privacy window, allow changes, click the plus icon, and navigate the the app. However, I don't think this will be needed, as I use a keycommand to navigate the Adobe Projector app.
